# Playing game with unbeatable A.I

The `MINIMAX` algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is used for finding the best move in a two player game and itâ€™s a recursive algorithm. 
Here are a few examples of games where Minimax can be applied:

* Tic-Tac-Toe (Beginner): In this classic game, the Minimax algorithm can be used to determine the best move for a player by recursively evaluating the game state and considering all possible moves and their outcomes. (Beginner Level)
* Connect Four (Intermediate: This is a two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. Minimax can be employed to analyze the game state and select the best move to win the game or prevent the opponent from winning.
* Chess (Advanced): Minimax is widely used in chess-playing algorithms. The algorithm searches through the game tree by considering all possible moves up to a certain depth and evaluates the positions based on heuristics or an evaluation function.
